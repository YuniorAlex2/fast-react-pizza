# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React-fast-pizza

## This is a project for my portafolio

The goal of the project was to build a web app for a pizza company. with the app you can input your name and add to a cart the amount of pizzas that you want. after adding to cart and ordered the pizza, you just need to input your info (first name, phone number, and the address to get your postion and help the deliver to get to you faster).

This app was built with react, redux, react-router, vite and tailwind.

Main project in Jonas Schmedtmann's Ultimate React Course.
